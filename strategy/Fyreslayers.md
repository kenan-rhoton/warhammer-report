# Fyreslayers

## The Units

We'll talk about all of the units, their options and considerations for them when being taken on any list.

However, some common things to take into account:

1. All heroes have 4+ Save
2. All other units have 5+ Save
3. Magmadroths move 12" reduced by wounds, duardin move 4" instead.
4. Magmadroths have 12 wounds, heroes have 5 or 6, units have 1 wound.
5. Heroes carry 1/3+/3+/-/1 8" throwing axes, other units have a 4+ hit instead.

### Auric Runefather on Magmadroth

The big daddy of all the Fyreslayers, the Runefather on Magmadroth (a.k.a. Magmadad) is a formidable fighter that will quickly become a high priority target for your opponent. If you keep him from dying, he can turn the tide allowing your other warriors to push through.

#### Weapon options

The Magmadad doesn't have any weapon options, but his sole profile is quite nice, wielding a 3/4+/3+/-1/3 Latchkey Grandaxe with the Weapon-breaker ability which can damage enemy HERO and MONSTER weapons.

However, the big source of damage is really the Magmadroth with its 6/4+/3+/-1/2 Claws and horns and his other abilities.

#### Abilities

The Magmadad's abilities are mostly great vs hordes and for supportish fights.

Magmadroth abilities:
- Roaring Fyrestorm: D3 or D6 mortal wounds shooting attack. Can be used even if you ran.
- Lashing Tail: D3 mortal wounds melee attack at end of combat phase.
- Volcanic Blood: D3 mortal wounds melee attack at end of any phase in which it suffered damaged.

Runefather abilities:
- Steadfast Advance (Command): Fyreslayers wthin 18" (24" if general) can re-roll BS and Saves of 1.
- Stare Down: -D3 Bravery to one unit at melee range
- Weapon-breaker: 50% chance to break a HERO or MONSTER's weapon on a save of 6+.

#### Notes

This guy deals a nice amount of damage and has great support abilities, but he is kinda squishy if focused.

Ideally, you want him to support a charge made by one of your frontline units (Vulkites or Hearthguard Berzerkers) rather than have him run in alone like a Frostlord on Stonehorn.

### Auric Runesmiter on Magmadroth

A pure support hero set up on top of a huge monster, what's not to love?

#### Weapon options

None. It looks like you can choose between Forge Key and Runic Iron, but the Key is just better: you're a support, you won't ever charge in and hit things unless forced to...

#### Abilities

Same Magmadroth abilities as above.

Runesmiter abilities:
- Runic Empowerment: Give wounds reroll to a Fyreslayers unit within 20". Wat.
- Grand ritual of awakening: Once per battle, instead do it to *all* Fyreslaters within 10". WAT.

#### Notes

If you didn't lose on the deep-strike from having him on foot this would be on every list. It's pretty bonkers, but Firedorfs have way too many competing crazy stuff.

### Auric Runeson on Magmadroth

You are allowed to charge this one in.

#### Weapon options

You can choose between an Ancestral War-Axe for maximum Berzerkerness (3/3+/4+/-/D3) or a Wyrmslayer Javelin to kill off opposing monsters (1/3+/3+/-1/D3 at 12", 1/4+/3+/-1/1 at 3").

The Javelin when shot against a monster does +2 damage.

#### Abilities

Aside from the usual magmadroth ones:
- Furious Onslaught (Command): Fyreslayers wholly within 12" can reroll charges.
- Explosive Rage: Pick a unit it can see. It gets -1 Bravery. Reroll Runeson's hits of 1 against it.
- Wyrmslayer Javelins: The aformentioned +2 damage in shooting phase.

#### Notes

This is mostly a monster killer with the javelin, but can rival the Magmadad damage up front as well.

### Auric Runefather

Pretty much the same as the Magmadroth version (minus the magmadroth stuff, obviously), but with a different command ability:
- Lodge Leader (Command): Nearby Fyreslayers can pile in 5". Also, on a 4+ you can redirect wounds or mortal wounds to another Fyreslayer unit within 3".

So he is almost as resilient as the Magmadroth if you spend the command point, but he's not a very good support, so it's a little suspect to take him unless you really need battleline Hearthguard Berzerkers.

### Auric Runesmiter

Same as Magmadroth version minus the big M, however he loses his Grand Ritual and instead gains the power to deep strike himself with another Fyreslayer Unit.

GGWP.

### Auric Runeson

On foot you'd better be taking the Javelin or he'll just die without doing anything.

His command ability becomes:
- Dauntless Assault: Reroll wound rolls of 1 for Fyreslayers wholly within 18".

### Grimwrath Berzerker

With a 4/3+/3+/-1/D3 Greataxe and the ability to hit twice... this is a berzerker.

#### Abilities

- Unstoppable Berzerker: 6+ Invulnerable Save. +1 to the roll for each enemy unit within 3".
- Dead, but not defeated: when slain in combat phase, on a 2+ he stays around until the end of the phase.
- Battle fury: Once per turn, after attacking, roll a dice. If result is less than wounds he has dealt, attack again immediately.

#### Notes

Now this is a striker. Charge him directly into battle at something you want to hurt. And the more surrounded he is, the more invincible he is. If you manage to ever get him within 3" of 5 different enemy units he becomes immortal.

### Auric Runemaster

Only take if you need Lords of the Lodge for Heartguard Berzerker cheesing. Next!

### Battlesmith

#### Abilities

Basically, he is two walking abilities:
- Icon of Grimnir: Fyreslayer units within 8" in the hero phase get to reroll failed saves until your next hero phase.
- None Shall Defile the Icon: When slain, a Fyreslayer unit within 5" can swear to protect the icon. They get rerolls to hits *and* wounds for the rest of the game, but they cannot move except to pile-in.

#### Notes

This guy makes your army almost immortal. His only problem is no invulnerable save on himself, but Ignax's Scales takes care of that.

### Vulkite Berzerkers

Both the hammer *and* the anvil.

#### Weapon options

- Fyresteel Handaxe: 2/4+/3+/-/1
- Fyresteel War-pick: 2/4+/4+/-1/1
- Bladed Slingshields: +1 Save in combat phase if you didn't charge that turn. When completing a charge, pick a unit and throw a dice for every Vulkite Berzerker within 8" of that unit. Each 6 is a mortal wound dealt.
- Pair of Handaxes: Reroll all failed hits.

#### Abilities

- Berserk Fury: Ignore wounds and mortal wounds on a 6. +1 to roll if 10+ models *at start of phase*. +2 if 20+.

#### Notes

Karl does +1 damage in melee.

Double handaxes make them deal a million damage. Slingshields packa punch and are great for holding. War-picks can penetrate through most armored units.

Always take in units of 30 if possible.

### Auric Hearthguard

Ranged damage. Just what was missing.

#### Weapons

- Molten Rockbolts (15"): 2/4+/3+/-1/1
- Magmapike: 1/4+/3+/-/1

#### Abilities

- Molten Rockbolts: if they deal any damage to a monster, at the end of the phase roll a dice. On 5+ its Move is halved and it takes -1 to hit.
- Sworn Protectors: +1 to hit if target is within 5" of a Fyreslayer Hero

#### Notes

Pretty good ranged option, especially paired with a Runesmiter to deep strike in.

### Hearthguard Berzerkers
