## Deployment

Stormcast won the roll and deployed first (blue area).

Stormcast decided to deploy his *Liberators* and *Sequitors* at 18" from the center objective, with the *Relictor* behind them.
One unit of *Prosecutors* was close to these units but towards the right flank and the other one was at 9" from the left objective.
*Aventis* was set up half-way between the left unit of *Prosecutors* and the main force.
*Gavriel* and the *Evocators* (the *Gavriel-Bomb*) were left in **Deep Strike**.

On the Fist of the Everchosen (red) side, the *Tzaangors* were set up at 9" from the center objective, with the *Kairic Acolytes* right behind them and the *Magister* + *Chaos Lord* as close to them as their 18" minimum alllowed.
The *Chaos Marauders* were set up as close to the left objective as possible, with the *Bloodsecrator* and *Slaughterpriest* as close to them as possible.
Finally, the *Blood Warriors* were set as a screen behind the army and to the right flank to avoid the *Gavriel-Bomb* landing and killing all the heroes or the *Kairic Acolytes*.
No 9" spaces were left behind the army,

## Round 1

Stormcast decided to give Fist of the Everchosen the first turn.

### Turn 1.1: Fist of the Everchosen

*Tzaangors* were given **Daemonic Power** by the *Chaos Lord*, the *Magister* gave **Mystic Shield** to the *Chaos Marauders* and the *Chaos Lord* gave his **Oracular Visions** to the *Blood Warriors*

#### Movement Phase

The entire army advanced running.
*Tzaangors* took the central objective, *Chaos marauders* took the left one, with the *Bloodsecrator* remaining at 6" from them and the *Slaughterpriest* close behind.
*Kairic Acolytes* kept up behind the *Tzaangors* and the *Magister* managed to catch up to them with an epic run roll.
The *Chaos Lord* slightly repositioned a bit to the left and the *Blood Warriors* spread out to the right again blocking any **Deep Strike** shenaningans.

#### Shooting Phase

The *Kairic Acolytes* weren't in range of anything.

### Turn 1.2: Stormcast Eternals

#### Hero Phase

*Aventis* failed casting an **Arcane Bolt** on the *Chaos Marauders* and successfully cast the **Azyrite Halo** on the *Sequitors*.
The *Lord-Relictor* succesfully prayed a **Translocation** for the *Sequitors* and set them up in the right flank at 9" from the *Blood Warriors*.

#### Movement Phase

Left-flank *Prosecutors* advanced to 3" from the *Chaos Marauders*, which were also approached by *Aventis*.
The *Liberators* advanced a little bit while the *Relictor* ran towards the left flank.
The right-flank *Prosecutors* moved to be at 18" from the *Tzaangors*.
